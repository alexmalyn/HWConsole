# HWConsole

***WIP***

A GUI for monitoring hardware. Kind of like a task manager/performance monitor

This is an experiment to learn about ECS and immediate mode at the same time. I like the idea of ECS and I've been curious about immediate mode for a while, so bevy_egui is perfect for this learning ourpose.
